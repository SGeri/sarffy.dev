    description: `I developed "Forródrót" - a web application that collects and organizes strikes and disobedience events within the education sector of Hungary. Built using Next.js with server-side rendering, the project utilizes TypeScript and a Postgres database with Prisma as the ORM. The project integrates with Google Sheets, and uses Material-UI as the design library. React-query and NextAuth were also implemented to handle state management and user authentication for the authors. The goal was to provide a centralized location for the public to stay informed about the issues facing the education system, and support the teachers and other education staff.`,

    description: `I developed a web application for a local high school to replace their outdated substitution table system with a new, more user-friendly and easily administered version. Utilizing Next.js for server-side rendering, the project was built with TypeScript and incorporated AWS DynamoDB as the database, with Vercel as the deployment platform and CI system. The design was implemented with Mantine as the UI framework. The goal of the project was to improve the design and control of the substitution table system for the school's administration and staff.`,
